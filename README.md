Second Self
To Be The Person You Wish You Could Be

This is an app intended for introverted students who want a fun, nonpersonal, and relaxed way to connect with each other. 
Second Self is a way to anonymize silly conversation.

Our target audience for our prototype is introverted Purdue students.
